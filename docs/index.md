## Application description: 
This application will display nearby parking suggestions and ratings. Users will have the ability to check out parking locations and rate their experience when visiting places of interest near the parking locations.

## Application Purpose: 
This app was important to us to create as we believe parking is a huge concern and an issue in Atlanta and in most major cities. An application that will give users location details and ratings and other information will be helpful in choosing a safe and close proximity parking lot when attending events or just running everyday errands.
